notifymuch
==========

This is a simple program that displays desktop notifications for unread
mail (or actually any query) in the notmuch database. The notification
can optionally have a button to run a mail client.

Configuration is stored in ``~/.config/notifymuch/notifymuch.cfg``,
which is created on first run.
